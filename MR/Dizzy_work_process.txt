	HW Product: HL7800
	Test Number: testid:testname
	i.e., 141505:A_INTEL_LTE_MECS_CTZU_0001 
	Step:
	1. Connect to HL7800 module using UART
	2. Enter AT+CPIN="3699" and AT+CMEE=1
	3. Enter AT+CTZU=0
	4. Enter AT+CTZU?

	Expected result:
	At step3, the module should return: \r\nOK\r\n
	At step4, the module should return: *+CTZU: 0*OK\r\n
